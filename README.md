#Fitness App React Front-End

The site is deployed on Vercel here: https://fitness-app-react-peach.vercel.app/

## In Case of Error
If the deployed website shows a connection error when trying to load the users:

1. You can find the backend Express app here: https://github.com/nith-yoga/FitnessAppAssignment.git
2. Use `node app.js` to run this app.
3. Then run this app with `npm run dev` and everything should connect.
